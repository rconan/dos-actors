# Mapping of CFD monitors to FEM input

The CFD windloads monitors record forces and moments on 94 locations.

There are 3 FEM windloads inputs:
 * CFD2025046F: the mount windloads
 * OSSM1Lcl6F: M1 segment windloads
 * MCM2Lcl6F: M2 segment windloads

The mount CFD input is divided is 78 locations where forces and moments are applied along the 3 OSS X,Y & Z axes.
The M1 and M2 segment forces and moments are removed as they are applied at the inputs OSSM1Lcl6F and MCM2Lcl6F, respectively, reducing the number of different locations to 66.
The other locations that are excluded are:
 * Ap instrument
 * Cable Trays
 * Cabs
leading to a total of 63 locations (or 378 forces and moments).
