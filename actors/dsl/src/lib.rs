# actorscript

A scripting micro-language for [gmt_dos-actors].

The `actorscript` procedural macro is a [Domain Specific Language] to write [gmt_dos-actors] models.

`actorscript` parses **flows**.
A **flow** consists in a sampling rate followed by a **chain**.
A **chain** is a series of pairs of actor's client and an actor output separated by the token `->`.

As an example:
```ignore
actorscript! {
    1: a[A2B] -> b
};
```
is a **flow** connecting the output `A2B` of client `a` to an input of client `b` at the nominal sampling rate.
This example will be expanded by the compiler to
```ignore
let mut a: Actor<_,1,1> = a.into();
let mut b: Actor<_,1,1> = b.into();
a.add_output().build::<A2B>().into_input(&mut b)?;
let model = model!(a,b).name("model").flowchart().check()?;
```
For the code above to compile successfully, the traits [`Write<A2B>`] and [`Read<A2B>`]
must have been implemented for the clients `a` and `b`, respectively.

The [gmt_dos-actors] model is written in the `completed` state meaning that the model is automatically run to completion

The state the model is written into can be altered with the `state` parameter of the `model` attribute.
Beside `completed`, two other states can be specified:
 * `ready`
```ignore
actorscript! {
    #[model(state = ready)]
    1: a[A2B] -> b
};
```
will build and check the model but running the model and  waiting for completion of the model
 is left to the user by calling
```ignore
model.run().await?;
```
 * `running`
```ignore
actorscript! {
    #[model(state = running)]
    1: a[A2B] -> b
};
```
will execute the model and waiting for completion of the model is left to the user by calling
```ignore
model.await?;
```

Clients are wrapped into an [`Arc`]`<`[`Mutex`]`<_>>` container, cloned and passed to the associated actor.
A reference to the clients can then be retrieved latter with the `lock` and `await` methods.
For example, a reference to the client `b` is obtained with:
```ignore
let b_ref = *b.lock().await;
```

## Model growth

A model grows by expanding **chains** with new links and adding new **flows**.

A **chain** grows by adding new clients and ouputs e.g.
```ignore
actorscript! {
    1: a[A2B] -> b[B2C] -> c
};
```
where the output `B2C` is added to `b` and connected to the client `c`.

A new **flow** is added with
```ignore
actorscript! {
    1: a[A2B] -> b[B2C] -> c
    10: c[C2D] -> d
};
```
Here the new **flow**  is down sampled with a sampling rate that is 1/10th of the nominal sampling rate.

Up sampling can be obtained similarly:
```ignore
actorscript! {
    1: a[A2B] -> b[B2C] -> c
    10: c[C2D] -> d
    5: d[D2E] -> e
};
```
In the model above, `C2D` is sent to `d` from `c` every 10 samples
and `D2E` is sent consecutively twice to `e` from `d` within intervals of 10 samples.

The table below gives the sampling rate for the inputs and outputs of each client:

|        | `a` | `b` | `c` | `d` | `e` |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| inputs | 0   | 1   | 1   | 10  | 5   |
| outputs| 1   | 1   | 10  | 5   | 0   |

## Rate transitions

The former example illustrates how rate transitions can happen "naturally" between client by
relying on the up and down sampling implementations within the actors.
However, this works only if the inputs and/or outputs of a client are only used once per **flow**.

Considering the following example:
```ignore
actorscript! {
    1: a[A2B] -> b[B2C] -> d
    10: c[C2D] -> b
};
```
The table of inputs and outputs sampling rate is in this case

|        | `a` | `b` | `c` | `d` |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| inputs | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| outputs| 1   | 1   | 10  | 0   |

Here there is a mismatch between the `C2D` output with a 1/10th sampling rate
and `b` inputs that have inherited a sampling rate of 1 from the 1st **flow**.

`actorscript` is capable of detecting such mismatch, and it will introduce a rate transition client
between `c` and `b`, effectively rewriting the model as
```ignore
actorscript! {
    1: a[A2B] -> b[B2C] -> d
    10: c[C2D] -> r
    1: r[C2D] -> b
};
```
where `r` is the up sampling rate transition client [Sampler].

## Feedback loop

An example of a feedback loop is a closed **chain** within a **flow** e.g.:
```ignore
actorscript! {
    1: a[A2B] -> b[B2C] -> c[C2B]! -> b
};
```
The flow of data is initiated by the leftmost client (`a`)
and `b` is blocking until it receives `A2B` and `C2B` but `c` cannot send `C2B` until he has received `B2C` from `b`,
so both `b` and `c` are waiting for each other.
To break this kind of stalemate, one can instruct a client to send the data of a given output immediately by appending
the output with the token `!`.

In the above example, `c` is sending `C2B` at the same time as `a` is sending `A2B` hence allowing `b` to proceed.

Another example of a feedback loop across 2 **flows**:
```ignore
actorscript! {
    1: a[A2B] -> b[B2C] -> c
    10: c[C2D]! -> d[D2B] -> b
};
```
This version would work as well:
```ignore
actorscript! {
    1: a[A2B] -> b[B2C] -> c
    10: c[C2D] -> d[D2B]! -> b
};
```

## Output data logging

Logging the data of and output is triggered by appending the token `$` after the output like so

```ignore
actorscript! {
    1: a[A2B]$ -> b[B2C]$ -> c
    10: c[C2D]$ -> d[DD]$
};
```
where `A2B` and `B2C` output data are logged into the [parquet] file `model-data_1.parquet` and
`C2D` and `DD` output data are logged into the [parquet] file `model-data_10.parquet`.
For logging purposes, `actorscript` rewrites the model as
```ignore
actorscript! {
    1: a[A2B] -> b[B2C] -> c
    10: c[C2D] -> d[DD]
    1: a[A2B] -> logging_1
    1: b[B2C] -> logging_1
    10: c[C2D] -> logging_10
    10: d[DD] -> logging_10
};
```
where `logging_1` and `logging_10` are two [Arrow] logging clients.
References to both clients is available after `actorscript` with
```ignore
*logging_1.lock().await
```
and
```ignore
*logging_10.lock().await
```

/**
Interpreter for the scripting language of [gmt_dos-actors] models.

Generates all the boilerplate code to build [gmt_dos-actors] models.

See also the [crate](self) documentation for details about building [gmt_dos-actors] models with [actorscript](actorscript!).

## Syntax

### Flow

```ignore
1: ...
```

A **flow** always starts with an integer literal following by colon, then a **chain**.

### Chain

```ignore
pair|client -> another_pair -> ... -> pair|client
```

The start and end of a chain can be either a client or a pair of a client and an ouput.

### Client-Output Pair

The syntax for a client-output pair is (optional parameters are preceded by `?`)
```ignore
?{ client ?::GatewayClient ?} [Output] ?suffix
```

* `client`: is the name of the client identifier that is the variable declared in the main scope.
If the client is surrounded by braces i.e `{sys}`, it is assumed to be a [gmt_dos-actors] [system].
The type of the client that receives an input or sends an output within a [system] acts as a gateway between the [system]
and the other clients and the gateway client can be specified by appending its type `GatewayClient`
to the [system] variable like so`{sys::GatewayClient}`.
* `Output`: is the type of one of the outputs of the actor associated with the client,
the client must implement the trait `Write<Output>`,
if it preceded by another client-output pair it must also implement the `Read<PreviousOutput>` trait.
* `?suffix`: optional operators applied to the ouput (suffix can be combined in any order (e.g `S!..` or `!..$` are both valid)):
  * `!`: output bootstrapping
  * `$`: data logging: creates clients variables `<model name>_logging_<flow rate>` and data file `<model name>_data_<flow rate>.parquet`,
  * `${n}`: same as above but also specifies the data size,
  * `..`: unbounded output
  * `~`: stream the output to a [gmt_dos-clients_scope] client

### Attributes

#### `model`

```ignore
#[model(key = param, ...)]
```
#####  keys
 * `name`: model variable identifier (default: `model`), this is also the name given to the flowchart
 * `state`: model state identifier: `ready`, `running` or `completed` (default: `completed`)
 * `flowchart`: flowchart string literal name (default: `"model"`)

#### `labels`

```ignore
#[model(<client> = "client label", ...)]
```
#####  keys
The key `<client>` is the name of the client identifier that is the variable declared in the main scope.
The label associated to the key will be display in the flowchart instead of the `<client>` type.

#### `images`

```ignore
#[model(<client> = "<png file>", ...)]
```
#####  keys
The key `<client>` is the name of the client identifier that is the variable declared in the main scope.
The image associated to the key will be display in the flowchart instead of the `<client>` type.
If a label is also given for the same key, it will written over the image.
