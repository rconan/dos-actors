# GMT Dynamic Optics Simulation Actors

The GMT DOS [Actor]s are the building blocks of the GMT DOS integrated model.
Each [Actor] has 3 properties:
 1. input objects
 2. output objects
 3. client

## Input/Outputs

input objects are a collection of inputs and
output objects are a collection of outputs.
An actor must have at least either 1 input or 1 output.
A pair of input/output is linked with a [channel](flume::bounded) where the input is the receiver
and the output is the sender.
The same output may be linked to several inputs.
[channel](flume::bounded)s are used to synchronize the [Actor]s.

Each [Actor] performs the same [task](Actor::task), within an infinite loop, consisting of 3 operations:
 1. receiving the inputs if any
 2. updating the client state
 3. sending the outputs if any

The loop exits when one of the following error happens: [ActorError::NoData], [ActorError::DropSend], [ActorError::DropRecv].

### Sampling rates

All the inputs of an [Actor] are collected are the same rate `NI`, and all the outputs are distributed at the same rate `NO`, however both inputs and outputs rates may be different.
The inputs rate `NI` is inherited from the rate `NO` of outputs that the data is collected from i.e. `(next actor)::NI=(current actor)::NO`.

The rates `NI` or `NO` are defined as the ratio between the simulation sampling frequency `[Hz]` and the actor inputs or outputs sampling frequency `[Hz]`, it must be an integer â‰¥ 1.
If `NI>NO`, outputs are upsampled with a simple sample-and-hold for `NI/NO` samples.
If `NO>NI`, outputs are decimated by a factor `NO/NI`

For a 1000Hz simulation sampling frequency, the following table gives some examples of inputs/outputs sampling frequencies and rate:

| Inputs `[Hz]` | Ouputs `[Hz]` | NI | NO | Upsampling | Decimation |
|--------------:|--------------:|---:|---:|-----------:|-----------:|
| 1000          | 1000          |  1 |  1 | -          |  1         |
| 1000          |  100          |  1 | 10 | -          | 10         |
|  100          | 1000          | 10 |  1 | 10         | -          |
|  500          |  100          |  2 | 10 | -          |  5         |
|  100          |  500          | 10 |  2 | 5          |  -         |

## Client

A client must be assigned to an [Actor]
and the client must implement some of the following traits:
 - [write](crate::io::Write) if the actor has some outputs,
 - [read](crate::io::Read) if the actor has some inputs,
 - [update](Update), this trait must always be implemented (but the default empty implementation is acceptable)

## Model

An integrated model is build as follows:
 1. select and instanciate the [clients]
 2. assign [clients] to [actor]s
 3. add outputs to the [Actor]s and connect them to inputs of other [Actor]s
 4. build a [mod@model]
 5. Check, run and wait for the [Model](crate::model::Model) completion

For more detailed explanations and examples, check the [actor] and [mod@model] modules.
