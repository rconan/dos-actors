# Actor inputs and outputs implementation module

[Actor]s communicate using channels, one input of an [actor] send data through
either a [bounded] or an [unbounded] channel to an output of another actor.
The data that moves through a channel is encapsulated into a [Data] structure.

Each input and output has a reference to the [Actor] client that reads data from
 the input and write data to the output only if the client implements the [Read]
and [Write] traits.
