# NGAO Optical Model

This is an optical model only of the NGAO system, with 1 GS on-axis, atmospheric turbulence and models of the pyramid wavefront sensor and the holographic dispersed fringe sensor, controlling `N_KL=66` Karhunen-Loeve modes of each M2 ASMS segment.

The number of Karhunen-Loeve modes can be changed by setting the `N_KL_MODE` environment variable.
